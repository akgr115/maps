# Homepage
The homepage will store the maps I've made so far alone. There is also a second page with resources I've used.

## Maps
This part will show you the maps I have made throughout the years, both Historical and Alternate maps.

### OTL
[Italy 1494](https://github.com/akgr115/maps/blob/gh-pages/Italian%20Map.png?raw=true)
[Ottoman Empire 16th-17th Century](https://github.com/akgr115/maps/blob/gh-pages/Ottoman%20Empire%20Map.png?raw=true)
I'm currently working on more OTL (irl historical maps) pieces.

### Alternate History/Fun Misc
[Alternate 1860 map](https://github.com/akgr115/maps/blob/gh-pages/My%20maps/Untitledwq.png?raw=true)
  Ok so I know this map is super weird. one thing you will notice is that Korea is where italy is, and italy is under japan. Why it's like this? i don't know. This is one of the many maps I made a long long time ago. Here is 2 more alternate versions: [British trade routes](https://github.com/akgr115/maps/blob/gh-pages/My%20maps/1860_January.png?raw=true), and [This infographic for the Italian Pen.](https://github.com/akgr115/maps/blob/gh-pages/My%20maps/Untitled1.png?raw=true). What anything in the latter half of the description is suppposed to mean? No clue either.
  
[Unnamed World Map](https://github.com/akgr115/maps/blob/gh-pages/My%20maps/Map%208_9_19%209_31AM.png?raw=true)
  Ohhhhhhh I remember this one. The best way to describe it is: Imagine a minecraft server. But you change the world from, a normal minecraft world, to a world map. From there, you can make countries on this map and build and stuff. Well this is the map that I had for a minecraft server I ran on a world map. It was super fun. The nations are pretty self explanatory. [This](https://github.com/akgr115/maps/blob/gh-pages/My%20maps/German%20Empire%20Factoid,%20Circa%20July%2023rd.png?raw=true) is a little infographic for the nation I ran on there, Germany. You can see from the original map that I expanded a bit after making that infographic, but it's still interesting nonetheless.

[Unnamed Map](https://github.com/akgr115/maps/blob/gh-pages/My%20maps/Political.png?raw=true) Well I remember making this but I don't remember much about the lore.   What I don't understand is how do empires like the French, Germans, or British exist, but the world is largely undiscovered? I remember that I planned to make some Asian countries but never got around to it. It's still a well made map though, and It's one of the only maps I used terra nullis in.

[Unnamed map](https://github.com/akgr115/maps/blob/gh-pages/My%20maps/map.png?raw=true)
  This one was sometime between 1870 and 1930, I know a lot happened between there but its somewhere in between it (remember this is alternate history). I don't really remember the lore on this one either nor what it was for.

[Furry Domination Map](https://github.com/akgr115/maps/blob/gh-pages/My%20maps/Furry_Domination_Map.png?raw=true)
  LMAOOO ok ok ok I remember this haha, You can read the description on the side but to explain further I used [this](https://www.furmap.net/) in order to make the map, and the lore was that furries took over the world and then you had to be one of the anti-furry nations and take the world back and "save humanity" it was 7th grade ok don't blame me. Unironically though, the map isn't too bad, it's super clean and its one of the only times I used a sidebar to explain things.
